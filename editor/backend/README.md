# CINCO-Cloud IDE - Backend

The backend is implemented as a java project. The custom backend-plugins can be located in `plugins/`.
The `releng/`-folder contains build-projects related to frontend- and backend-plugins like the language-server.

## Build the backend
There are two ways to build the backend.
1. Running `./run.sh -b` in the root folder of the cinco-cloud ide
2. Use maven directly and build a project, e.g. releng/de.jabc.cinco.meta.core.parent
