# Introduction

Cinco Cloud is a generator-driven development environment for domain-specific graphical modeling tools.
It aims to provide a low-code way to develop further low-code/no-code environments for arbitrary use cases.

Graphical low-code/no-code environments developed with Cinco Cloud are completely generated from an intuitive higher-level abstract specification language. Semantics-inducing parts of the tool that are difficult to define in an abstract declarative way (such as model interpreters, transformations, or code generators) are written in JavaScript or TypeScript against a simple model-based API.

Cinco Cloud cloud is a holistic approach in that it provides:

1. A meta-level to model graphical low-code/no-code environments using its DSLs MGL and MSL, as well as its APIs to enrich functionality with code generators, validation, and much more.
2. The graphical low-code/no-code environments powered by Sprotty in which domain experts can model intuitively.
3. Providing ways to deploy products generated by the low-code/no-code environments in 2.
4. User management, access management, and more in the surrounding Cinco Cloud web application.
