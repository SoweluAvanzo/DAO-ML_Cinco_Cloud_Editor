# Coding conventions

## Code Formatting

For CincoCloud, we adhere to the [google code styling][google-styleguide] conventions.
You should import one of the following files in your IDE to ensure your code is formatted properly:

* Eclipse: `.resources/eclipse-java-google-style.xml`
* Intellij: `.resources/eclipse-java-google-style.xml`

Since we lint our code in the CI/CD pipeline, please ensure that the code is formatted properly.
