<h2>CINCO CLOUD - ARCHETYPE - LANGUAGES EXTENSION</h2>

</div>

## Contents

Theia Extension for our own Meta Graph Language (MGL), Meta Style Language (MSL) and CPD. The MGL is built with [Langium][langium] to take full advantage of the [Language Server Protocol (LSP)][lsp].
Each language consists of a language definition (.langium) and a module and validator.
For a preview of how those languages can look like, there are example MGLs in the examples directory.
