## Dependencies

- NodeJS (version 18.9.0)
- Yarn

NOTE: we recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#install-script) to use NodeJS 18.9.0 for development use.

    nvm install 18.9.0
    nvm use 18.9.0
    npm install -g yarn

### Common Pitfall

If you change the node version using nvm while using vscode and want to execute a run/debug configuration of
the project, vscode will use the version of node, that was present while it was opened. vscode will not
update the node version using nvm.

## Install linux packages (if necessary)

    sudo apt-get install g++-4.8 libsecret-1-dev xvfb libx11-dev libxkbfile-dev libxml2-utils

## Install python and additional dependencies (needed by theia dependencies)

Please check the installation description [here](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation).

(On Windows run: ```npm config set msvs_version 2019```)

## Developing with the browser example (untested)

0. If you want to build everything run the following command inside this folder:

    ```yarn```

1. Start watching changes on the extension via

   ```cd [theia-extension-name] && yarn watch```

   This command starts watching the changes within the extension, e.g. whenever you update any
   of the source code files within the extension

2. Start watching the browser app via

   ```cd browser-app && yarn watch```

   This command watches for changes within the browser app and rebuils it, e.g. this is the
   case whenever the extension-changes finished rebuilding, as the browser has a depedency
   on the extension. Note that rebuilding the browser app might take a couple of seconds. You can
   verify that it finished building the browser-app by looking at the hash of the bundle generated by
   webpack

3. Start the browser app with

   ```cd browser-app && yarn start```

   This start the browser app on `http://localhost:3000`

**NOTE**: The browser does not reload automatically whenever you changed something, you need to reload yourself currently.
